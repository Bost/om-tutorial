# Om Tutorial Code

This is a project holding an Om (next) project that is to be used
as the basis of a complete overview of the features of Om. For 
simplicity, the server-side component is simulated in the browser. 
The code you would write on the server is identical (though you 
will need some minor plumbing to do the actual network bits).
